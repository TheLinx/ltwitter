h1. ltwitter

ltwitter is a Twitter API wrapper for Lua. It is managed by "Linus SjÃ¶gren":http://github.com/TheLinx.
The code is licensed under the CC0 license. Basically, public domain.

h2. Dependencies

Here's a list of stuff ltwitter needs to run:
* "LuaOAuth":http://github.com/ignacio/LuaOAuth/
* "JSON4Lua":http://json.luaforge.net/


All these should be automatically installed if you install ltwitter with LuaRocks.
You don't _need_ JSON4Lua, any module called "json" that has a decode function should work.

h2. Including ltwitter in your script

Example:

bc. require("twitter")
myClient = twitter.client("OAuth consumer key", "OAuth consumer secret")
status = myClient:showStatus{id = 123}
print(status.text)

ltwitter stays very close to the original Twitter API. All arguments passed to a function will be passed on as GET/POST data in the request.
Therefore, to know what arguments you can use for what functions, use the "official Twitter documentation":http://dev.twitter.com/doc.

A list of functions and their respective API resource is in init.lua (lines 20 -> 120).
